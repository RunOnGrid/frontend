           A decentralized cloud is a cloud computing model that distributes data processing across multiple nodes worldwide, instead of relying on a centralized data center. This model provides better availability and redundancy, ensuring applications and data remain functional even if a node fails. Additionally, the decentralized cloud offers greater privacy and data security, as users can retain control of their own data.

              In a decentralized cloud, we use advanced security measures such as firewalls, data encryption, and applications. By distributing your data across multiple nodes, it is harder for attackers to access and compromise the entire system. Additionally, in the event of an attack, we can isolate and address the problem in a specific node rather than affecting the entire system, increasing the security of the service.
